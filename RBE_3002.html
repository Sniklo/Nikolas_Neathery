						<h2>Overview</h2>
						<p>
							RBE 3002 is an introduction to ROS-based mobile robot autonomy.
							The primary goal of this project was to autonomously explore and map an unknown maze,
							localize within the generated map using SLAM, and plan a collision-free path to a target
							location using A*.
						</p>

						<p>
							Development began entirely in simulation, then was migrated to a physical TurtleBot
							equipped with LiDAR. The project highlighted one of the biggest lessons in robotics:
							<strong>simulation-to-real deployment is rarely seamless</strong>, and real sensor noise,
							timing, and calibration issues fundamentally affect system behavior.
						</p>

						<h2>How It Works</h2>

						<h3>Mapping & Frontier Exploration</h3>
						<p>
							To map an unknown environment, we used a frontier-based exploration strategy.
							Frontiers represent boundaries between known free space and unknown space.
							The robot repeatedly selected the best frontier (largest/most informative unknown region),
							drove to it, updated the occupancy grid using LiDAR, then repeated until no
							actionable frontiers remained.
						</p>

						<h3>Localization with SLAM</h3>
						<p>
							Once a map was created, the robot was placed into an unknown (random) pose and needed to
							relocalize itself. LiDAR scans were matched against the occupancy grid map to estimate pose.
							This allowed consistent navigation even after being moved, as long as the robot could
							obtain recognizable scan features.
						</p>

						<h3>Path Planning with A*</h3>
						<p>
							With a known map and estimated pose, the robot planned a route to a goal location using A*.
							The occupancy grid was treated as a graph, with obstacle inflation applied to maintain a safety
							margin around walls. The resulting path was then executed through ROS navigation controls.
						</p>

						<h2>Simulation → Real Robot Challenges</h2>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Sensor noise:</strong> LiDAR scans were less clean than simulation and required tuning.</li>
							<li><strong>Odometry drift:</strong> wheel slip and small errors accumulated over longer trajectories.</li>
							<li><strong>Timing + latency:</strong> ROS node update rates mattered more on real hardware.</li>
							<li><strong>Map consistency:</strong> small offsets in transforms could distort or misalign the map.</li>
						</ul>

						<hr class="major" />

						<h2>Outcome</h2>
						<p>
							The final system successfully mapped an unknown maze environment, localized from a random
							start pose, and navigated to target positions using A* planning. More importantly, the project
							provided hands-on experience with ROS-based autonomy and the practical difficulties involved
							in transitioning from simulation to physical hardware.
