						<p><strong>Course Project | Soft Robotics | University of Southern Denmark</strong></p>

						<p>
							This project focused on replicating a pneumatically actuated soft crawling robot
							originally developed at Harvard University, while replacing the original
							multi-material, multi-nozzle 3D printing process with a modular mold-based
							manufacturing approach.
						</p>

						<hr class="major" />

						<h2>Mold Design & Manufacturing</h2>

						<p>
							The robot was fabricated using a multi-stage silicone molding process.
							Hollow triangular prisms were cast using 3D-printed molds to ensure
							airtight internal cavities. A second mold stage was used to add a
							stiffer silicone layer to one face of each prism, creating asymmetric
							bending behavior.
						</p>

						<p>
							The structure was built modularly, with independent rows fabricated
							separately to reduce risk of total failure due to manufacturing defects.
							This approach replaced the original fully integrated multi-nozzle print.
						</p>

						<h2>Locomotion Mechanism</h2>

						<p>
							The robot consists of rows of hollow triangular silicone prisms
							arranged into two groups:
						</p>

						<ul>
							<li><strong>Inner rows</strong> (central modules)</li>
							<li><strong>Outer rows</strong> (external modules)</li>
						</ul>

						<p>
							Each prism bends directionally due to asymmetric stiffness.
							When vacuum is applied (<strong>On</strong>), the internal cavity collapses
							and the prism bends toward the softer side. When vacuum is released
							(<strong>Off</strong>), the structure reinflates and returns to its original shape.
						</p>

						<h3>Four-Stage Crawling Cycle</h3>

						<ol>
							<li>
								<strong>Stage A — On Inners / Off Externals</strong><br>
								The inner rows contract under vacuum. This lifts and shifts the central
								body forward due to asymmetric bending. Initial forward displacement
								along the x-axis occurs here.
							</li>

							<li>
								<strong>Stage B — On Inners / On Externals</strong><br>
								The outer rows contract, lowering the robot and anchoring the outer
								feet to the surface. This stabilizes the body and prevents backward slip.
							</li>

							<li>
								<strong>Stage C — Off Inners / On Externals</strong><br>
								The inner rows reinflate while outer rows remain contracted.
								The reinflation pushes the body upward and forward against the
								anchored outer feet. This is the primary propulsion phase.
							</li>

							<li>
								<strong>Stage D — Off Inners / Off Externals</strong><br>
								Both groups reinflate, redistributing weight evenly and resetting
								the robot for the next cycle.
							</li>
						</ol>

						<p>
							Forward motion emerges from timed load transfer between rows,
							asymmetric material stiffness, and friction at the reinforced tips.
							The gait resembles a soft-material analog of inchworm locomotion.
						</p>

						<h2>Control & Pneumatic System</h2>

						<p>
							The system uses an external vacuum generator for contraction and
							Arduino-controlled mini pumps for inflation. Valve states are
							controlled through a timed state-machine sequence.
						</p>

						<p>
							System performance is primarily limited by:
						</p>

						<ul>
							<li>Inflation and deflation response time</li>
							<li>Vacuum strength</li>
							<li>Silicone stiffness</li>
							<li>Surface friction</li>
						</ul>

						<hr class="major" />

						<h2>Performance Results</h2>

						<ul>
							<li><strong>10.6 mm/s</strong> on rigid wood surface</li>
							<li><strong>7.24 mm/s</strong> on foam surface</li>
							<li>Fivefold velocity increase after pneumatic redesign</li>
						</ul>

						<hr class="major" />

						<h2>Conclusion</h2>

						<p>
							This project demonstrated that advanced soft robotic locomotion
							can be achieved without specialized multi-material 3D printing.
							Through modular mold fabrication and pneumatic optimization,
							a functional crawling soft robot was successfully created.
						</p>

						<p>
							The work highlights the adaptability of soft robotic manufacturing
							and provides a foundation for future improvements such as
							closed-loop control, steering mechanisms, and improved gait efficiency.
