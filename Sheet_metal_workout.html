						<h2 id="content">Overview</h2>
						<p>
							This project focused on designing and manufacturing a multi-purpose cable-based workout
							machine that uses a pneumatic piston as its resistance element. Starting from an initial
							concept of a simple rowing mechanism, our team extended the design into a configurable
							cable machine capable of multiple exercises (e.g., high row, face pull, triceps push-down),
							while maintaining a robust, manufacturable structure.
						</p>

						<p>
							In addition to the mechanical system, we integrated a measurement and user interface
							stack that provides real-time workout metrics such as repetitions, session duration,
							estimated lifted weight (derived from piston pressure), and mechanical power output.
						</p>

						<h2>How it works</h2>
						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-12">
								<h3>Training Concept</h3>
								<p>
									The machine is built around a top-mounted cable path and pull bar. In the primary
									configuration, the user sits low and performs a pulling motion down toward the chin
									while keeping the back straight (lat/high-row style). The same geometry supports other
									exercises without reconfiguring the pulley layout, including triceps push-downs and face pulls.
								</p>

								<h3>Stroke Extension via Pulley Ratio</h3>
								<p>
									A key design challenge was achieving a large user range-of-motion with a piston that had
									a limited stroke length. Instead of changing the piston (not allowed by constraints), we used
									a reduction system with two drums/pulleys of different diameters on a shared axle.
									The piston drives the smaller drum, while the output cable runs on the larger drum,
									creating a ~1:1.5 motion ratio. This effectively increases the bar travel relative to piston travel,
									allowing the desired motion range while staying within the piston’s physical limits.
								</p>

								<h3>Manufacturability-Driven Sheet Metal Design</h3>
								<p>
									The frame was designed around the available bending equipment. The structure uses simple
									U-profiles sized to avoid collisions in the bending machine, with added clearance where
									profiles intersect to account for bending inaccuracies. Riveted joints were used for fast,
									repeatable assembly, and shaft holes were oversized except where precision fits were required
									(e.g., bearing interfaces).
								</p>

								<h3>Hybrid Idler Pulley Manufacturing</h3>
								<p>
									Custom all-metal pulleys were impractical under the project’s time/cost constraints, and
									off-the-shelf parts were not an option. Our solution was a hybrid pulley design:
									laser-cut steel side plates provide strength, bearing support, and load transfer, while a
									3D-printed drum forms the groove/profile needed for reliable cable routing.
									Bolts clamp the assembly together, ensuring durability and consistent force transmission.

						<h2>Measurement, Data Acquisition, and UI</h2>

						<h3>Sensors and Arduino Pipeline</h3>
						<p>
							An Arduino Uno collects two primary signals: (1) a potentiometer mounted to the main pulley
							to measure rotation (mapped to linear piston displacement), and (2) a pressure sensor in the
							air tank to measure piston pressure. The microcontroller converts analog readings using its
							10-bit ADC and streams processed values over serial for visualization.
						</p>

						<h3>Workout Metrics</h3>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Reps:</strong> counted by detecting angle thresholds in the pulley rotation.</li>
							<li><strong>Estimated Weight:</strong> derived from pressure and piston area (pressure → force).</li>
							<li><strong>Mechanical Power:</strong> computed using velocity and pressure-derived force.</li>
							<li><strong>Session Duration:</strong> timer incremented on the Arduino and displayed live.</li>
						</ul>

						<h3>User Interface</h3>
						<p>
							A Python UI (built with PyQt) reads the serial output and displays user-friendly metrics
							in real time. The interface updates at 0.1 s intervals and includes both a user view and
							a developer/debug view (raw sensor values, voltages, and internal calculations). A physical
							button on the Arduino provides a quick “reset UI” function for reps and timer.
						</p>

						<h2>Testing & Results</h2>
						<p>
							The system was validated by running a test session consisting of 5 full-range pulls with the
							pneumatic system pressurized to 3 bar. Logged data confirmed expected relationships between
							pressure, effort force, equivalent lifted weight, and power output, and demonstrated that the
							bar range-of-motion is larger than the piston stroke due to the pulley ratio.
