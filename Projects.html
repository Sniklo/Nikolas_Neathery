									<p>My goal with any project, personal or professional, is to enhance the skills I have currently and learn new ones. I imagine I have a tool box containing every skill I have learned throughout my college and professional career. I constantly am trying to add new tools to the box and hone the ones that are already in there.</p>
									<p>Below are a few of the projects that I have either completed or am currntly working on. The projects themselves were completed in WPI courses, were personal projects, or were applications where I applied my skills to solve a problem in my everyday life. Projects that included some form of software will have a link to a GitHub repository where the code can be viewed, as well as any other supporting documents.</p>

												<h3>Trash Collecting Robot *In Progress*</h3>
											</header>
											<p>This project is a work in progress for my masters thesis. The goal is to create a mobile robot to pick up trash, leaves and any other forms of clutter. The robot is designed and built from the ground up and incorperates seveal areas of robotics including mechanical, electrical and software design,</p>

												<h3>Dynamic Workout Machine</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The goal of this project was to create a workout machine that could be used for both anarobic and arobic exercises. Meaning that it could be used for both high weight low rep and low weight high rep. This was done by controlling the pressure in a piston as resistance for the machine. For this project I was responsible for design and manufacturing. Design was done using onshapes sheet metals tools and for manufacturing I utilized a laser cutter for the majority of the structure, a lathe for all the pulley axels and a 3D printer for the pulleys. </p>

											<p>Locomotion via a soft robot is what was required for this project. This was done using rows of hollow triangular prisms that flex when deflated. When these rows are syncronized this causes the robot to move forward. This project was primarily mechanical/manufacturing related.</p>

											<h3>RBE: 3001</h3>
										</header>
										<p>WPI structures the courses such that the beginning ones introduce mechanical, electrical and software skills while the later courses focus on less broad skills within these branches. One of the more advanced projects I worked on was using a 3 DOF arm to sort colored balls. We had to derive the forward and inverse kinematics for the arm to accomplish this task. All the code was done in MATLab which on its own was a bit of a challenge being that I had never done such a major project in that format. Despite this I like to say this is my favorite course that I took while attending WPI due to the challenge it posed and how well the theory transferred to practice in the lab.</p>

											<h3>RBE: 3002</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Following this was the introduction to ROS. The goal of this project was to navigate a maze using A* and SLAM for localization. For this we used turtle bots with lidar. To start, everything was done in SIM then was migrated to a physical robot. This demonstrated that this transition is rarely seamless. The first challenge of the project was figuring out how to map the unknown area. We accomplished this by approaching the largest unknown area or frontier and reassessing the area until there were no longer unknown areas or frontiers. Once this was completed the robot was placed in a random location and needed to localize itself then drive to a desired position.</p>

												<h3>RBE: 450X</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The latest project I completed was using a 2 DOF arm and a camera to find an ideal grasp for an object. The camera returned RGB D data in the form of a point cloud. This was again done using ROS 2 and was only in simulation. Once we had the point cloud, the top layer of the object was separated and from here an optimal grasp was derived. When I took it was in the experimental stage, and had never been taught with the use of ROS 2. For me this was my first time using ROS 2 and I not only became familiar with point clouds, edge detection and grasp derivation but also how to convert libraries meant for ROS 1 to ROS 2.</p>

											<h3>Christmas gift to mom</h3>

										<p>When ever its time to give gifts I much prefer making them. Especially when it comes to family. Every year I try and make some sort of practical gift for my parents. This year I decided to make a giant salad bowl. The piece on the right started as a large square of glued together chunks of wood. From there I turned it down into the bowl shape and then soaked it in a food safe oil.</p>

												<h3>Major Qualifying Project</h3>

											<p>WPI requires every student to complete an MQP or major qualifying project. This is a project that takes place over the course of a year and is directly related to your major. For my project two other WPI students and I are working with Flexxbotics to better integrate a Universal Robot with a HAAS CNC machine using ROS to resolve alarms on the machine during lights out operation. ROS is also being used to aggregate data from both systems and report run records to the cloud for analysis. </p>

										<!-- <p>Recently my dad reached out to me with a proposal to make a 3D printed bolt carrier for an AR to help show how to correctly assemble it. For this I needed to pull the CAD files for the carrier and blow it up so its five times the actual size then modify it so they are able to be printed. For this I also needed to generate an expense report and proposal to be approved.</p> -->

											<h3>FRC Mentorship</h3>

										<p>I can confidently say that I am where I am today because of the FIRST Robotics program. While on the team I helped the team gain a district championship and lead the team to a dominant worlds performance where we finished as finalists. Now it is my goal to give back to the program by mentoring current highschool students. I do this by oarticipating as the lead design mentor responsible for teaching students CAD and coaching the drivers durring matches.</p>
